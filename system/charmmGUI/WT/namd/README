# The following shell script assumes your NAMD executable is namd2 and that
# the NAMD inputs are located in the current directory.
#
# Only one processor is used below. To parallelize NAMD, use this scheme:
#     charmrun namd2 +p4 input_file.inp > output_file.out
# where the "4" in "+p4" is replaced with the actual number of processors you
# intend to use.

set equi_prefix = step4_equilibration
set prod_prefix = step5_production
set prod_step   = step5

# Running equilibration step
./namd2 ${equi_prefix}.inp > ${equi_prefix}.out
